        <p>
            I am Spencer Knight. I am a Husband, a Father, and a Cybersecurity major. 
            I meet my wife on Mutualâ€¦ Yes it can work. 
            We ended up getting married just after one year of dating.
            I have one stepson, Justin who is almost 5, and one Daughter who is just over 2 months old. 
            I love the desert and mountains, hiking, fishing, and to shoot guns.
            I look forward to this class and learning as much as I can!
