                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely! This is a great trip for children of all ages, though kids over 8 seem to enjoy it the most (and so do their parents!). A common concern is that kids will be bored on the boat, but we rarely see bored children. The stunning scenery, wildlife, and exciting rapids keep everyone engaged. Plus, each boat has a guide who entertains with stories—some of which are even true!</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h3>
                    <p>As with all adventure sports, there is some risk. Our guides are certified in Wilderness First Aid and have at least three years of rafting experience. Most injuries are minor (like sunburns or those that happen on land). Everyone wears a Coast Guard-approved life vest (PFD). Non-swimmers are welcome! You'll receive a fun, in-depth safety talk before you begin.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is included in the trip?</h3>
                    <p>We provide all necessary camping equipment: sleeping bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle and day bag, tent, cot, eating utensils, and a camping chair. Water and lemonade are available during the day, with coffee, tea, and hot chocolate in the mornings and evenings. You may bring a small amount of beer, liquor, or soft drinks. All meals and snacks are included.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What do I need to bring?</h3>
                    <p>Be ready for both hot/dry and cold/wet conditions. Bring rain jacket and pants (no ponchos), quick-dry shirts and shorts, long sleeve cotton shirts/pants for sun, swimwear, hat with strap, sunglasses with strap, socks, sandals or water shoes, comfortable camp wear, sleepwear, water bottle, day pack, lotion, headlamp or flashlight, sunscreen and lip balm, gloves, fleece jacket, towel, bandana, small pillow, hygiene products, and camera or journal.

                    <h3>What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h3>
                    <p>What's not great! Imagine: waking up under the stars, having a delicious breakfast, spending the day surrounded by stunning canyons, running rapids, hiking, learning about the area's history and geology, and ending with a riverside dinner—think steak, salmon, or dutch oven brownies—followed by more stories and another peaceful night under the stars. It's an adventure you won't forget!</p>

                    <h3>How far in advance should I book my trip?</h3>
                    <p>If you have specific dates, book a year in advance. Otherwise, booking six months ahead is usually enough if you’re flexible.</p>
