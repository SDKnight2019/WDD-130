          My name is Spencer Knight, and I am a Cybersecurity major at BYU-Idaho.
          I am passionate about technology and its potential to improve our lives.
          Here, I have highlighted two academic projects and one personal project that I am proud of.
          These projects showcase my skills and growth as a Cybersecurity professional.
          I have also included my resume and a summary of my technical skills 
          to help you get to know me and understand what I can bring to the field.

        This is my home lab that I have set up to learn more and test different tools and theories about Cybersecurity.
        I chose to use an old computer that my wife doesn't use anymore, so I could recycle it instead of throwing it away.
        I have set up a headless Ubuntu server that I can access remotely so I can work on it from anywhere.
        I have also set up VMware on it to run virtual machines.
        I have also set up a Windows VM that I can use to learn more about Windows security,
        by both performing blue team and red team exercises in and against it.
        I have also installed and set up Kali Linux on my laptop so I can use it for penetration testing,
        allowing me to use the tools that are available on Kali Linux.
        On my Windows VM I will also be setting up ELK stack and/or Security Onion so I can read the logs and familiarize myself with both of them,
        and learn how to use them to detect attacks and other security issues in different computer systems.

        This is a project that I did in my intro to programming class at BYU-Idaho.
        It is a project where I had to pull in data from a file, sort the data
        , and then display the data by the year of interest.
        The data was the maximum life and minimum life for the year of interest along with the program being to be able to
        see if the year that the user wanted the information on was found in the data.
        I chose to import the data from a CSV file, then sort through it using if statements
        , and then display the data for the year of interest to the user. I am proud of this project
        because it was the first time I had to import data from a CSV file and then
        sort it to display it in a way that was easy to read and understand, 
        along with one of the first times that I successfully programmed with functions.
