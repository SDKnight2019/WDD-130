          My name is Spencer Knight, and I am a Cybersecurity major at BYU-Idaho.
          I am passionate about technology and its potential to improve our lives.
          Here, I have highlighted two academic projects and one personal project that I am proud of.
          These projects showcase my skills and growth as a Cybersecurity professional.
          I have also included my resume and a summary of my technical skills 
          to help you get to know me and understand what I can bring to the field.

        This is my home lab that I have set up to learn more about Cybersecurity.
        I have set up a headless Ubuntu server that I can access remotely and work from anywhere.
        and set up VMware on it to run virtual machines.
        I set up a Windows VM that I can use to learn more about Windows security,
        by doing both blue team and red team exercises in and against it.
        I have also installed and set up Kali Linux on my laptop so I can dual-boot
        allowing me to use the tools that are available on Kali Linux,
        to perform penetration testing and other security tasks related to red team tasks.
        On my Windows VM I will also be setting up ELK stack and Security Onion so I can read the logs,
        and learn how to use them to detect attacks and other security issues in different computer systems.

        This is a project that I did in my CSE 110 class at BYU-Idaho.
        It is a project where I had to pull in data from a CSV file, sort the data
        , and then display the data for the year of interest.
        The data was the max life and min life for the year of interest
        and if the year was found in the data.
        I chose to import the data from a CSV file, then sort using if statements for the data
        , and then display the data for the year of interest. I am proud of this project
        because it was the first time I had to import data from a CSV file and then
        sort it to display it in a way that was easy to read and understand.
